What memory issue exists in this caching implementation?

```csharp

public static class Cache
{
    private static Dictionary<int, object> _cache = new Dictionary<int, object>();
    
    public static void Add(int key, object value)
    {
        _cache[key] = value;
    }
    
    public static object Get(int key)
    {
        return _cache.TryGetValue(key, out var value) ? value : null;
    }
}
```
The provided caching implementation has a potential memory issue related to memory leaks due to the following reasons:
1. Static Dictionary Keeps References

    * The _cache is a static dictionary, which means it will live for the entire duration of the applicationâ€™s lifetime unless explicitly cleared.
    * Any objects stored in this dictionary will not be garbage-collected even if they are no longer needed elsewhere in the application. This could lead to memory leaks, especially if the cache grows large or stores heavy objects.

2. Unbounded Growth

    * There is no eviction policy or size limitation implemented in the cache. If many keys and corresponding values are added over time, the dictionary could grow indefinitely, consuming increasing amounts of memory, which can eventually lead to OutOfMemoryException.

3. Potential Boxing/Unboxing Issues (Performance)

    * If the value stored in the cache is a value type (e.g., int, double), it will be boxed when stored in the dictionary because it is stored as object. This can lead to unnecessary memory overhead and performance degradation.

4. Thread Safety

    * The code is not thread-safe. If multiple threads attempt to access or modify _cache at the same time, race conditions, data corruption, or runtime exceptions might occur. While this is not directly a memory issue, it can exacerbate problems if the data is corrupted.

# Suggested Fixes:

To address these issues, consider the following improvements:

1. Use a ConcurrentDictionary for Thread Safety
```csharp
private static ConcurrentDictionary<int, object> _cache = new ConcurrentDictionary<int, object>();
```
2. Implement an Eviction Policy Use a caching library like .NET MemoryCache or implement a custom mechanism to limit the size or age of items in the cache. For example:

```csharp
private static MemoryCache _cache = new MemoryCache(new MemoryCacheOptions());

public static void Add(int key, object value)
{
    _cache.Set(key, value, TimeSpan.FromMinutes(10)); // Expire after 10 minutes
}

public static object Get(int key)
{
    return _cache.TryGetValue(key, out var value) ? value : null;
}
```
3. Monitor and Clear Cache Periodically Add logic to periodically monitor the cache size and remove unused or old entries.

4. Avoid Storing Large Objects Be cautious about caching large objects or objects with deep reference graphs to avoid excessive memory usage.
