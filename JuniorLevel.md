Review the following code.

 ```csharp
public class DataProcessor
{
    private List<string> _data = new List<string>();
    
    public void ProcessData()
    {
        for(int i = 0; i < 10000; i++)
        {
            _data.Add(new string('x', 10000));
        }
    }
}
```
This code can lead to a potential memory issue: excessive memory consumption and memory pressure on the managed heap, which might eventually result in an OutOfMemoryException or trigger frequent garbage collection, especially in long-running applications.
 ```csharp
_data.Add(new string('x', 10000));
```
This line adds a 10,000-character string to the _data list in each iteration. Since the loop runs 10,000 times, it results in:
* 100 million characters total.
* Each char in .NET is 2 bytes (UTF-16), so this is approximately:
 ```
10000 strings × 10000 chars/string × 2 bytes/char = ~200 MB
 ```
The actual memory usage will be higher due to:

Overhead of each string object.

Overhead of list internals and growth (resizing array).

Pinned memory if interacting with native code (less relevant here but a possible scenario).

Potential promotion to gen 2 in the garbage collector if this object lives long.

# Potential memory issue:
Unbounded memory growth: There's no cap or cleanup strategy.

Long-lived memory pressure: _data is a class-level field, so it will remain in memory for the lifetime of the DataProcessor instance, preventing GC from reclaiming those strings.

Possible LOH (Large Object Heap) allocations: Each string is 20,000 bytes; anything >85,000 bytes lands in LOH, so individual strings are fine, but collectively they still cause memory pressure.
